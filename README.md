# Homework 0

Welcome to CS193X! This assignment is designed to help you get set up with your development environment and with our homework turn-in system. It also gives us a chance to get to know you a little better, too!

This is not intended to take a very long time to complete, but please get started sooner rather than later so we can fix any issues before the first real homework assignment.


## Part 1: Getting started with GitHub.
We will be using GitHub Classroom for homework distribution and turn-in. This will lead you getting started with GitHub and Git.

**If you are familiar with Git and GitHub, skip to Part 2.**

### 0. What is Git and GitHub?

- **Git** is a [version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control), which is a program that developers use to track and manage changes to source code over time.
- GitHub is a company that provides hosting for code that is managed by the Git version control system.

Git and GitHub are sophisticated tools for collaborative software development, used by millions of software developers worldwide. Git is incredibly powerful, but it has a somewhat notoriously steep learning curve.

Luckily for CS193X, we will only be using a very small subset of Git and GitHub's features.

We will be using GitHub for the following purposes:
1. You will download ("**clone**") the homework starter code from GitHub.
2. You will upload ("**push**") your homework solution code to GitHub.
3. You will publish your web page(s) to the internet via GitHub Pages.


### 1.  Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)
_Skip this if you already have a GitHub account._
- You will need a GitHub account to use GitHub Classroom.
- Sign up for one if you don't have one already.


### 2. Get the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
_Optional - not needed for the course_

- This is not necessary for CS193X, but GitHub offers a bunch of free services for students, including free unlimited private GitHub repositories.
- Learn more and sign up via the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

### 3. Decide if you want to use GitHub on desktop or command-line
_Either is fine; up to what you are most comfortable with._
